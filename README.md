Vibe coded RAG Pipeline to build Architectural context into AI reviews

TODO:
1. Consider only comments that have been incorporated.
2. Also consider comments which are not incorporated but acknowledged to be taken up later.
3. ONLY for non AI-agent comments, also include comments where the reviewer suggests a future action.
4. Build a semantic comparator of newly generated guidelines with existing guidelines.
5. In guideline clusters, along with cluster ID, output cluster slogan.
6. Ensure to have each comment tied back to relevant guidelines
